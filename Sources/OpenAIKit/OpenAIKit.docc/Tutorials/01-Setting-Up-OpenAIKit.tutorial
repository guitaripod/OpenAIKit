    @Intro(title: "Setting Up OpenAIKit") {
        Configure OpenAIKit in your Swift project and authenticate with the OpenAI API.
        
        This tutorial covers installation, API key management, and basic configuration options.

            First, you'll add OpenAIKit as a dependency to your Swift project using Swift Package Manager.
            
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Open your project in Xcode and navigate to **File â†’ Add Package Dependencies**.
                
                @Code(name: "Package.swift", file: setup-01-package.swift)
            }
            
            @Step {
                Enter the OpenAIKit repository URL and select your version requirements.
                
                @Code(name: "Package.swift", file: setup-02-package.swift) {
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                Add OpenAIKit to your target's dependencies.
                
                @Code(name: "Package.swift", file: setup-03-package.swift)
            }

    @Section(title: "Obtain an API Key") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            To use OpenAI's API, you need an API key from your OpenAI account.
            
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and sign in to your account.
                
            }
            
            @Step {
                Navigate to the API Keys section in your account settings.
                
            }
            
            @Step {
                Click "Create new secret key" and give it a descriptive name.
                
            }
            
            @Step {
                Copy your API key immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
                
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Section(title: "Configure OpenAIKit") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            Now let's initialize OpenAIKit with your API key. We'll use environment variables for security.
            
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Create a new Swift file for your OpenAI client setup.
                
                @Code(name: "OpenAIClient.swift", file: setup-04-empty.swift)
            }
            
            @Step {
                Import OpenAIKit and create a shared instance.
                
                @Code(name: "OpenAIClient.swift", file: setup-05-import.swift)
            }
            
            @Step {
                Add a computed property to safely retrieve your API key from environment variables.
                
                @Code(name: "OpenAIClient.swift", file: setup-06-apikey.swift)
            }
            
            @Step {
                Initialize the OpenAIKit client with your API key.
                
                @Code(name: "OpenAIClient.swift", file: setup-07-init.swift)
            }
            
            @Step {
                Add error handling for missing API keys.
                
                @Code(name: "OpenAIClient.swift", file: setup-08-complete.swift)

            @Step {
                In Xcode, edit your scheme by clicking the scheme selector and choosing "Edit Scheme".
                
            }
            
            @Step {
                Navigate to the Run section and select the Arguments tab.
                
            }
            
            @Step {
                Add your API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
                
            }

            What is the recommended way to store your OpenAI API key?
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: false) {
                Hardcode it directly in your source code.
                
                @Justification(reaction: "Incorrect") {
                    Never hardcode API keys in your source code! They could be exposed in version control.
                }

            @Choice(isCorrect: true) {
                Use environment variables or secure storage like Keychain.
                
                @Justification(reaction: "Correct!") {
                    Environment variables and Keychain keep your API keys secure and out of your source code.

                    UserDefaults is not secure for sensitive data like API keys.
