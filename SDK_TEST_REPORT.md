- **Vector Stores** - Part of Assistants (beta)
- **Fine-tuning** - Not implemented

## Critical Fixes Applied

1. **URL Construction** - Fixed 404 errors by correcting path building
2. **Function Calling** - Made content optional for function-only responses
3. **Binary Responses** - Added special handling for audio data
4. **Audio Usage** - Created dedicated AudioUsage struct
5. **Image Usage** - Enhanced for gpt-image-1 model support

## Recent Additions

### Model Constants
- Type-safe model names (no more string literals)
- Includes model metadata and capabilities
- Prevents typos and improves code maintainability

### Batch API
- Full async batch processing with 50% cost savings
- JSONL file creation and parsing utilities
- Support for up to 50,000 requests per batch

### Enhanced Error Handling
- UI-ready error messages and titles
- Retry guidance with suggested delays
- User action suggestions for common errors

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
swift run OpenAIKitTester all

# Test specific features
swift run OpenAIKitTester chat
swift run OpenAIKitTester batch
swift run OpenAIKitTester error-handling
```

## Recommendations

### Use in Production âœ…
- All implemented features are thoroughly tested
- Enhanced error handling provides excellent UX
- Type-safe model constants prevent errors
- Batch API offers significant cost savings

### Best Practices
1. Use `Models` constants instead of string literals
2. Implement retry logic with `RetryHandler`
3. Show user-friendly error messages
4. Handle optional content in chat messages
5. Use streaming for better UX on long responses

### Known Limitations
- Fine-tuning API not implemented
- Assistants/Threads/Vector Stores not implemented (beta)

## Conclusion

OpenAIKit is a robust, production-ready SDK for Swift applications. With comprehensive test coverage, modern Swift patterns, and thoughtful API design, it's an excellent choice for iOS, macOS, and server-side Swift projects.
