## DeepResearch Feature Details

### Overview
DeepResearch is an advanced research capability that extends beyond standard chat completions, providing:
- **Web Search Integration** - Access to current information beyond model training data
- **MCP Tool Support** - Integration with external data sources and APIs
- **Code Interpretation** - Execute and analyze code dynamically
- **Multi-step Research** - Can take tens of minutes for comprehensive analysis

### Supported Models
DeepResearch uses specialized models through the Responses API:
- `o3-deep-research` - Most capable research model for comprehensive analysis
- `o4-mini-deep-research` - Faster research model for quicker results

These models are accessed through the `Models.DeepResearch` constants and require at least one tool (web search or MCP) to be configured.

### Important Notes
- **Long Running Operations** - DeepResearch can take tens of minutes to complete
- **Tool Requirements** - Must include at least one tool: `web_search_preview` or `mcp`
- **Extended Timeouts** - Configure timeouts up to 30 minutes for complex research
- **Background Mode** - Consider using background mode for production applications

### Test Coverage
DeepResearch capabilities are tested through:
- Responses API integration with proper field mapping
- Tool configuration (web search, MCP, code interpreter)
- Handling of incomplete responses and long-running operations
- Token usage tracking with Responses API-specific fields
- Updated streaming chunk structure to match DeepResearch SSE format

### Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Non-streaming DeepResearch requests work correctly
- ‚úÖ Proper model structure with all required fields
- ‚úÖ Tool configuration support (web_search_preview required)
- ‚úÖ Streaming implementation works with proper SSE parsing
- ‚úÖ Background mode support added for long-running tasks
- ‚úÖ Content handling supports both string and array formats
- ‚úÖ Full message content extraction with proper type handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  DeepResearch responses require high token limits (20,000-30,000) for complete responses
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  With lower token limits, responses return "incomplete" status

### Key Findings
DeepResearch models operate differently from standard chat models:
1. **Token Requirements**: Minimum 16 tokens, but typically need 20,000-30,000 for complete responses
2. **Research Process**: Models perform multiple web searches and reasoning steps before generating final output
3. **Incomplete Status**: With limited tokens, models will return "incomplete" with only reasoning/search outputs
4. **Background Mode**: Recommended for production use due to long execution times (tens of minutes)
5. **Content Format**: Message content is returned as an array of content objects, not a simple string
6. **API Access**: DeepResearch uses the Responses API (`openAI.responses.create`), not a separate endpoint

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
swift run OpenAIKitTester all

# Test specific features
swift run OpenAIKitTester chat
swift run OpenAIKitTester batch
swift run OpenAIKitTester error-handling
swift run OpenAIKitTester deepresearch
```

## Recommendations

### Use in Production ‚úÖ
- All implemented features are thoroughly tested
- Enhanced error handling provides excellent UX
- Type-safe model constants prevent errors
- Batch API offers significant cost savings

### Best Practices
1. Use `Models` constants instead of string literals
2. Implement retry logic with `RetryHandler`
3. Show user-friendly error messages
4. Handle optional content in chat messages
5. Use streaming for better UX on long responses
6. For research tasks, use DeepResearch with appropriate tools:
   - Enable web search for current information
   - Configure MCP tools for domain-specific data
   - Use code interpreter for data analysis tasks

### DeepResearch Usage Guidelines
When using DeepResearch models (`o3-deep-research`, `o4-mini-deep-research`):
1. **Set High Token Limits**: Use `maxOutputTokens: 20000` or higher for complete responses (30,000 recommended)
2. **Use Background Mode**: For production, set `background: true` and implement webhook/polling
3. **Expect Long Execution**: DeepResearch can take tens of minutes to complete
4. **Handle Incomplete Status**: With lower token limits, expect "incomplete" status with partial results
5. **Required Tools**: Always include at least one tool (typically `web_search_preview`)
6. **Monitor Progress**: In streaming mode, track web searches and reasoning steps
7. **Extract Content Properly**: Use `item.content?.text` to access message content from the array format
8. **Use Responses API**: Access via `openAI.responses.create()`, not a separate DeepResearch endpoint

### Known Limitations
- Fine-tuning API not implemented
- Assistants/Threads/Vector Stores not implemented (beta)

## Conclusion

OpenAIKit is a robust, production-ready SDK for Swift applications. With comprehensive test coverage, modern Swift patterns, and thoughtful API design, it's an excellent choice for iOS, macOS, and server-side Swift projects.
