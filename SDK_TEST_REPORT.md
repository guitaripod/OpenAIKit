```bash
# Run all tests
swift run OpenAIKitTester all

# Test specific features
swift run OpenAIKitTester chat
swift run OpenAIKitTester batch
swift run OpenAIKitTester error-handling
```

## Recommendations

### Use in Production âœ…
- All implemented features are thoroughly tested
- Enhanced error handling provides excellent UX
- Type-safe model constants prevent errors
- Batch API offers significant cost savings

### Best Practices
1. Use `Models` constants instead of string literals
2. Implement retry logic with `RetryHandler`
3. Show user-friendly error messages
4. Handle optional content in chat messages
5. Use streaming for better UX on long responses

### Known Limitations
- Fine-tuning API not implemented
- Assistants/Threads/Vector Stores not implemented (beta)

## Conclusion

OpenAIKit is a robust, production-ready SDK for Swift applications. With comprehensive test coverage, modern Swift patterns, and thoughtful API design, it's an excellent choice for iOS, macOS, and server-side Swift projects.
